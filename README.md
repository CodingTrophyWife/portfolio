# Discription
This is my second challenge for school where the task was to create a portfolio where I will one day put all my projcts that I'm most proud of. But for now i filled the spaces with things I love! 

## Shout Out's (Contributing)
A big thank you to W3schools for hooking me up with so much info. Saved my ass with the stupid flex boxes. 

Huge shout out to my teacher for helping me wrap my text under the picture! 

There was a kid in class that helped me figure out the whole side section piece! super dope of him for helping me! 

My hubby, bless his heart, for having the patience to deal with me and talk me off the ledge when I wanted to quit. He reminded me that if I want to buy anything I want, I need a big pay check coming in so I pulled myself together and got it done. I might have bought myself something as well just to help make me feel better. 

Last but not least, I'd like to thank me. For always pushing through the hard moments (even when you dont want to) and not FULLY giving up!
