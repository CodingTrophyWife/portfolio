                    <p>What can I say about myself that hasn’t been written on a bathroom stall somewhere, besides me saying whatever 
                    you read is most likely true. I am an open book! I have no filter. I’m the type of friend that your friends have to
                    warn new people about.  My favorite part is watching people figure me out. At first, they think, “she is super shy, she 
                    doesn’t talk much, I could definitely take her places and have a nice relaxing day.”  But then time goes by and I start opening
                    up to you and your thoughts start becoming more like, “I can’t believe she just did that!” I speak mostly in quotes from movies 
                    and tv shows. I own a lot of clothes for someone who prefers not to wear clothes. My kids call me a Winnie the Pooh kind of mom because 
                    I wear just oversized t-shirts with no pants almost 24/7. Most little girls dream of growing up to be nurses or teachers or even princesses 
                    but not me. When I was younger I dreamed of growing up to be in Playboy. Yes, you read that correctly. I set my goals high. I wanted to be a 
                    centerfold. Now you’re probably asking yourself, "Cyndi if those were your dreams how did you get into web design?" Good question. My short answer
                    is my kids ruined my body. Nobody wants to open a Playboy and see a mom on the hood of a car with stretch marks and a c-section scar. So instead, I married 
                    a software engineer who gave me financial stability to go out and try different things out to find what my new passion is going to be. I worked in clothing stores 
                    thinking I would like it, but it turns out people are the worst, especially during the holiday season. "No lady, I can’t fit this huge men’s winter coat into a t-shirt size box, 
                    no matter how much you scream and yell at me I can’t change physics." So after that attempt and failure I decided to try my luck in the health care industry. I went on to
                    work at two different nursing homes and one mental health hospital. Although it is a rewarding job, you are greatly underpaid and underappreciated. I know it’s a thankless job
                    but a simple Thank you or I appreciate you wouldn’t hurt every once in a while. So that brings me to now and this chapter of my life story. This chapter is called "Why not me". I used to 
                    think a top paying job with a salary would never happen for me. I would think I wasn’t smart enough, or everyone would find out that I had no idea what I was doing. And the truth is, everyone 
                    feels like that. So I asked myself, "Why not you Cyndi? Why can’t you be successful and bring home the big paychecks?" So I told myself "you can do this and you will do this!"
