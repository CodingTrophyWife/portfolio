Bootcamp Challenge Two

Description
This is a portfolio of my work for employers to view. It includes a section where I will (eventually) put links to projects I'm most proud of. It also has links to my contact information.

It has multiple :hover and :active features, as well as transitions.

Website Link
The website can be found here!
